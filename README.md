# CNN_Colorize_Images
In this project, we use convolutional neural network for image colorization which turns a grayscale image to a colored image.

By converting an image to grayscale, we loose color information, so converting a grayscale image back to a colored version is not an easy job.

We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset.
